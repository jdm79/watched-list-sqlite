# Python movie watchlist terminal app with a SQLite database

This is from the Tecladocode's [_The Complete Python/PostgreSQL Course 2.0_](https://pysql.tecladocode.com/).

Once you've git cloned it to your machine, cd into the directory and run with the following command on your terminal: 

```
$python3 app.py
```
You should then have something like what is below to play with.
